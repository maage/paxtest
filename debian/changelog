paxtest (0.9.6-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Made the do_mprotect() call in body.c optional, thereby introducing two

    blackhat mode, which does.
  * Added a README file
  * Added Adamantix paxtest results
  * Removed -etdyn from the Adamantix make file
  * Replaced mprotect() in body.c with pthread calls (which eventually have
    the same result)
  * Added a nested function, to measure the effect of nested functions on the
    level of protection.
  * Added paxtest result from Gentoo hardened (thanks to Ned Ludd)
  * Added a new Makefile for Gentoo (thanks to Ned Ludd)
  * Fixed spelling errors (thanks to pageexec@freemail.hu)
