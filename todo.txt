    - gcc trampolines are (properly) emulated
    - signal handler return trampolines are (properly) emulated
    - valid signal handler return trampolines are automatically emulated
    - .plt entries are (properly) emulated

    - .text section of the kernel is read-only
    - nothing but the .text section of the kernel is executable
    - .rodata section of the kernel is read-only

    - mmap(PROT_EXEC|PROT_WRITE) creates a rw- mapping (silent removal of x)
    + mmap(~MAP_FIXED) returns a randomized address for file mappings
    + mmap(~MAP_FIXED) returns a randomized address for anonymous mappings
      if a 0 hint was specified
    + stack is at a randomized address
    + main executable is at a randomized address (for both ET_EXEC and ET_DYN
      ELF files)
    - task's kernel stack pointer is at a randomized address, and it changes
      on every system call
